ABOUT

Adds a field display formatter to allow you to display field content using
Slick carousel. The module doesn't require Field UI to be enabled by default
(so you can leave it off once everything is configured) but it is recommended
to use to setup your display settings.


SUPPORTED FIELDS
All is applicable only to multi-value fields.
- Image
- Text, Text long, Text with summary
- Media Entity via slick_media contrib [1]
- Paragraphs via slick_paragraphs contrib [2]

USAGE

Manage the fields on any entity (e.g.: node of type Article):

"admin/structure/types/manage/article/display"

Select any field of type "Image", "Media Entity" or "Paragraphs" and set the
display options to "Slick Text", "Slick Image", "Slick Media" or
"Slick Paragraphs", "Slick ...", accordingly under "Format".

Adjust formatter options accordingly, including your optionset.

The more complex is your slide, the more options are available.

If using Media, Paragraphs, or other Slick entity reference formatters, be
sure to provide relevant View mode, and the fields are made visible at their own
Manage display page.

You can put any field type as Caption fields, and have custom work going such as
with animated caption fields with animate.css, etc. using a long text field.
Further work is required like everything else, but the ease of field composition
is there without too much custom code, except for CSS which is normal for any
site building.

OPTIONSET
To create your option sets, go to:

"admin/config/media/slick"


SLIDE LAYOUT
The slide layout option depends on at least a skin selected. No skin, just DIY.
Core image field support several caption placements/ layout that affect the
entire slides uniformly.

If you have more complex need, use Media entity, Paragraphs, or other Slick ERs.
You can place caption at different positions per individual slide as long as you
provide a dedicated "List (text)" with the following supported/pre-defined keys:
top, right, bottom, left, center, below, e.g:

Option #1
---------

bottom|Caption bottom
top|Caption top
right|Caption right
left|Caption left
center|Caption center
center-top|Caption center top
below|Caption below the slide


Option #2
---------

If you have complex slide layout via Media Entity/ Paragraphs with overlay video
or images within slide captions, also supported:

stage-right|Caption left, stage right
stage-left|Caption right, stage left
stage-zebra|Stage zebra


Option #3
---------

If you choose skin Split, additional layout options supported:

split-right|Caption left, stage right, split half
split-left|Caption right, stage left, split half
split-zebra|Split zebra


Split means image and caption are displayed side by side.

Specific to split layout, be sure to get consistent options (left and right)
per slide, and also choose Skin main "Split" to have a context per
slideshow. Otherwise layout per slideshow is useless.

Except the "Caption below the slide" option, all is absolutely positioned aka
overlayed on top of the main slide image/ background for larger monitor.
Those layouts are ideally applied to large displays, not multiple small slides,
nor small carousels, except "Caption below the slide" which is reasonable with
small slides.


Option #4
---------

Merge all options as needed.
