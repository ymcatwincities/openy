  # We use the XML data parser plugin.
  plugin: url

  # Normally, this is one or more fully-qualified URLs or file paths. Because
  # we can't hardcode your local URL, we provide a relative path here which
  # hook_install() will rewrite to a full URL for the current site.
  urls: /migrate_example_advanced_position?_format=xml
  # Visit the URL above (relative to your site root) and look at it. You can see
  # that <response> is the outer element, and each item we want to import is a
  # <position> element. The item_xpath value is the xpath to use to query the
  # desired elements.
  item_selector: /response/position
  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an xpath for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_xpath.
  fields:
    -
      name: machine_name
      label: 'Unique position identifier'
      selector: sourceid
    -
      name: friendly_name
      label: 'Position name'
      selector: name
  # Under 'ids', we identify source fields populated above which will uniquely
  # identify each imported item. The 'type' makes sure the migration map table
  # uses the proper schema type for stored the IDs.
  ids:
    machine_name:
      type: string
process:
  # Note that the source field names here (machine_name and friendly_name) were
  # defined by the 'fields' configuration for the source plugin above.
