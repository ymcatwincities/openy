# This is a shared configuration file that is intended to be stored in the project repo.
# For local overrides:
# - create .docksal/docksal-local.yml file and put local docker-compose configuration overrides there
# - add .docksal/docksal-local.yml to .gitignore

# Docksal stiches several docker-compose configuration files together.
# Run "fin config" to see which files are involved and the resulting configuration.
