Panelizer
---------
The Panelizer module allows supported entities to be treated as Panels [1],
giving options for different default displays on a per bundle basis. For
example, this allows each node display to be customized individually.


Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Supports Drupal core's included entities - nodes, taxonomy terms and users.

* Can be easily extended to support additional entities.


Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CTools v8.x-3.x [2]
Panels v8.x-4.x

This version is only designed to be compatible with Drupal 8.3.x and above, it
is not compatible with 8.2.x and the Layout Plugin module.
