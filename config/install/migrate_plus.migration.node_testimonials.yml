        <p>Dan Marcinko has been involved at the Snoqualmie Valley YMCA since it opened five years ago. Born and raised in Winfield, Illinois, his family frequently visited the Glen Ellyn YMCA where they enjoyed swimming, playing basketball, hanging out in the teen center, and taking in an afternoon movie. Based on his experiences growing up with the YMCA, Dan was excited to participate in planning Snoqualmie’s first YMCA. His family of five immediately joined the Y and have enjoyed all aspects of the facility ever since.</p>
        <p>Dan has three teenage children—a daughter and two sons. Two of his children are enrolled at WSU (go Cougs!) and his youngest is a junior at Mount Si High School. About a year ago, Dan started participating in a YMCA wellness program to improve his health. Although not an easy journey, he is proud to report a weight loss of more than 40 pounds through a healthy diet combined with 5 AM daily workouts at the Snoqualmie Valley YMCA.</p>
        <p>In addition to the fitness benefits, Dan also enjoys the sense of community and the family atmosphere of the Y. He has made many friends during his workouts and says “The Y is the hub of the community. It’s where people can go and not only work out but also see a smiling face, ask questions, or enjoy a cup of coffee with good conversation. Even if you come here alone, you’ll leave with many new friends.”</p>
        <p>Embarking on a health journey is not easy, but Dan encourages people to keep trying until they find what works for them. Most of all, he insists that they don't give up and encourages them to try different types of workouts, whether it be individual, group, or both. For Dan, group workouts offered the best system in terms of motivation and consistency toward reaching his goals.</p>
        <p>In addition to working out at the Y, Dan enjoys family time, hiking, and square dancing—an activity he has participated in since early childhood and now enjoys with his wife.</p>

         <p>Shawn is a former resident of the Accelerator YMCA’s McGrath House, which is part of our Transitional Housing Program. Shawn was referred to the McGrath House through the Youth Housing Connections (YHC) central referral system for King County. He was a resident at McGrath for about 14 months.</p>
         <p>He was living in his car when he was referred to our program. He was working 40 hours per week at an auto lube company, but was having an extremely difficult time securing housing due to poor credit and having no rental history.</p>
         <p>Shawn had some money saved up, but not enough to pay for the high move in costs that most open apartments require. When Shawn learned about McGrath, he quickly set up a tour of the house, paid his deposit and first month’s program fees and moved into his room at McGrath. He was appreciative of the opportunity to have a home, and developed a plan to move out on his own as soon as he was ready. Shawn met with Y staff to discuss his plan and through this process he decided that he could take on a second part-time job. Within a week he had secured a flower delivery job.</p>
         <p>He became a role model to other residents in the program as he went to work every day, paid his rent on time each month and maintained a calm cool demeanor at all times. Shawn would often talk with other residents about staying positive and taking advantage of what the YMCA’s Transitional Housing Program can provide.</p>
         <p>Although Shawn was doing well and had several months left to move out before he graduated from the program, he decided that he was ready to live on his own. Shawn secured his own apartment with two roommates in Oregon and received a transfer in his job. Shawn moved out of the McGrath House in February 2016 and is confident that he can maintain full independence.</p>

         <p align="JUSTIFY">Alive &amp; Free, a program of the Accelerator YMCA,  helps young people break the cycle of violence and detention through direct street and community outreach. Young adults like Jerry*, who  was affiliatted with a gang, using drugs, and not going to school.  Jerry's  Alive &amp; Free outreach worker knew he had been detained for some of these activities, and began visiting him at Juvenile Detention to help him make plans for his next steps after release.</p>
         <p align="JUSTIFY">After detention, connecting Jerry with drug and alcohol counseling was a big first step in helping him stay clean and sober. His outreach worker also provided support to get Jerry back in school and secure a paid internship. Jerry’s journey has not been easy but he is in the process of getting his life on track. He is now attending Renton YouthSource to receive his GED and is finishing up Alive &amp; Free’s internship project, where he is learning job and life skills through airbrush art.</p>
         <p align="JUSTIFY">These positive activities and support from his outreach worker have allowed Jerry to reduce his gang involvement and drug use. Seeing and achieving measurable success in his life and has given Jerry more confidence in himself and his future. Now he is positively moving towards an improved quality of life.</p>
