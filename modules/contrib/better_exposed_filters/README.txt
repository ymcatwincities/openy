-- SUMMARY --

The Better Exposed Filters module replaces the Views' default single-  or
multi-select boxes with more advanced options such as radio buttons, checkboxes,
toggle links or jQueryUI widgets.

Views Filters are a powerful tool to limit the results of a given view. When you
expose a filter, you allow the user to interact with the view making it easy to
build a customized advanced search.  For example,  exposing a taxonomy filter
lets your site visitor search for articles with specific tags.  Better Exposed
Filters gives you greater control over the rendering of exposed filters.
