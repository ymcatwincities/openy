Welcome to Socrates
=====

Socrates is an OOP representation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern for OpenY to cover needs of
pluggable distributed Data Wrapper services by priority.

Basically, if you have a membership calculator which should be used for display same thing but for different Data
Services, Socrates gives you a convenient opportunity to define which service should be used for obtaining data
on specific project. The highest priority service will be chosen for retrieving data.

For connecting your service to Socrates you need to

- implement OpenyDataServiceInterface for the service's class
- extend your_module.services.yml with tags

```
  example_socrates_data_service:
    class: Drupal\openy_socrates\ExampleSocratesDataService
    tags:
      - { name: openy_data_service, priority: 1000 }
```

- replace the Data service with Socrates everywhere you need to have an ability to prioritize Data retrieving.
