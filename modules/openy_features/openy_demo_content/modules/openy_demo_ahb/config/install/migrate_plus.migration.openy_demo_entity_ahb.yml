          <li>We strongly recommend that you perform any actions on this Dashboard only on the <strong>NON-production</strong> environment!</li>

          <li><strong>Resolve conflicts.</strong><br />
            Press diff button next to a conflict and decide what should be done with this config.<br />
            You can approve current changes or revert to a config from Open Y.<br />
            Also, you can choose to resolve conflict manually. To do so you can apply changes from both current version and from Open Y.</li>
          <li><strong>Generate</strong> a function for hook_update. Resulting code will contain all of your actions for programmatic conflict resolution.</li>
          <li>Insert generated code to any custom module (Use MODULE_NAME.install file. Additional information about update hooks can be found <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Extension%21module.api.php/function/hook_update_N/8.2.x">HERE</a>).</li>

          <li>Test this update on the DB dump of the website version that was created before conflicts were resolved.</li>
          <li>Execute <strong>drush updb -y&nbsp;</strong></li>
