      description: |
        <p>Everyone knows the Y as a place to camp, swim, or exercise. Yet, the
        Y is so much more. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, we provide
        crucial programs and services to more than 230,000 people every year.
        With the help of generous donors, we are able to provide more than 250
        homeless youth safe, stable housing, 115,000 healthy meals to
        school-age youth, and more than $9.5 million in financial assistance to
        more than 27,000 people to ensure everyone has a chance to succeed and
        belong at the Y.</p>
