        	<li><em>Only one in three lower income youth participate in out-of-school time or
        	expanded learning programs in St. Paul and Minneapolis, according to Youthprise.</em></li>
        	<li><em>Youthprise also reports that approximately 33 percent – more than 250,000 – of
        	all Minnesota children not currently enrolled in out-of-school opportunities would be
        	likely to participate if a program were available in their community.</em></li>
        	<li><em>According to the U.S. Department of Education, Minnesota ranks among the bottom

        </ul>
        <p>The YMCA of the Greater Twin Cities, a leading nonprofit dedicated to strengthening
        communities through youth development, healthy living and social responsibility,
        creates safe, engaging spaces for young people to learn and grow outside of school.</p>
        <p>Studies show that more than 250,000 kids in Minnesota would participate in out-of-school
        activities if a program were available in their community. The Y strives to meet this need
        by developing enrichment programs that meet young people in their schools or in their
        homes.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“The YMCA is committed to expanding outside its four walls to reach young people where
        they are,” said Glen Gunderson, president and CEO of the Y. “Access is a key factor to
        keeping our youth safe and engaged outside of school, and the Y removes barriers so that
        all in our community can participate.”</p>
        <p>Gunderson added that the Y team designs programs that are flexible and can meet the needs
        of specific communities. YMCA out-of-school education and enrichment programs are found in
        Y facilities, schools, apartment complexes, mobile home communities and more, and include
        the following opportunities:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Educational support, including homework help and targeted reading, math or science
        	activities to increase achievement and confidence</li>
        	<li>Enrichment activities like art, dance, music and more</li>
        	<li>Career pathways and leadership development opportunities through YMCA Teen
        	Thrive programming</li>
        	<li>Programs like Beacons in Minneapolis or School Success in St. Paul that bring before
        	and after school programs directly to students’ schools, free of charge</li>
        	<li>On-campus programming at the University YMCA to engage with students across a variety
        	of academic and cultural backgrounds at the University of Minnesota and to build connections
        	with community schools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See how Suzie has experienced the power of the Beacons program to build young leaders
        throughout its 20 years in the Twin Cities, and how she has grown from student to program
        director – <a href="https://youtu.be/xGKzTXM2acE">Beacons Network: 20 Years of Helping
        Young People Thrive</a>.</p>
        <p>Because the Y is a leading nonprofit committed to helping all learn, grow and thrive,
        financial assistance is available based on need.</p>

        <p>By Glen Gunderson</p>
        <p>Like many of you, my mind is spinning because of international, national and local events
        that have centered around racism, from the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood
        Arrivals (DACA), to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, to the bombing of the Dar Al-Farooq
        Islamic Center in Bloomington.</p>
        <p>It seems as if racial issues crop up on a near daily basis.</p>
        <p>But I was heartened and inspired by a note from Kevin Washington, the president and CEO of YMCA
        of the USA. He reminded the Y family that we “resolve to be light in this darkness” and that we stand
        in opposition to hate, racism and white supremacist ideology.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>“As an organization and as individuals privileged to play this vital role, we have an obligation
        to be purposely and fully inclusive, across all dimensions of diversity,” Kevin wrote. “We should
        never accommodate or legitimize hate, but we should continue to build bridges with reasonable people
        who challenge us to consider other perspectives. Unity requires all of us—For a better us.”</p>
        <p>I am proud of the work the Y does every day to bring groups together, build bridges of understanding
        and brighten people’s lives. As I visited our many youth programs this summer, I saw firsthand how
        intentional we are to teach our future generations — from all racial, cultural and socio-economic
        backgrounds — how to learn, grow and thrive together in a safe environment.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        In the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, we cannot always build a future for our youth, but
        we can always build our youth for the future. In our YMCA programs, we are instilling the Y’s core
        values of caring, honesty, responsibility and respect. This is the foundation upon which we are
        preparing our youth to be the best they can be – leader, parent, neighbor, citizen.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />
        I know my own perspective, my worldview, is tainted by white privilege. I have never worried about
        how I may be treated when stopped by a police officer. I have not experienced biases that impact
        whether I will be hired, promoted or given a raise. I have never lost sleep over whether my children
        will be given a fair chance in life. As a servant to our Twin Cities community, I try to see through
        a different lens, void of white privilege.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>And what I see is not pretty.</p>
        <p>As we start a new school year, please keep pushing our youth to try new things, learn more about
        the world and people around them. To embrace similarities, with empathy and humility. And yet just
        as importantly, celebrate differences. To be kind and gracious, never mean or selfish.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>That starts with us being a light and investing in them. Thank you for making a difference and
        preparing our youth to enjoy a world where racism no longer exists – that is our hope we must
        strive for every day.</p>

        <p>For many kids, summer is considered to be a magical time. Summer means potential, energy and time
        for unstructured play. Magnify that magic with Y summer camp programs!</p>
        <p>The Y is one of the largest providers of camp programs with over 1,850 day camps across the country.
        Many Y programs promote learning lifelong skills, developing character and making friends, but camp
        is a very special environment.</p>
        <p>There are so many reasons for kids to attend camp. Here are just a few things your child can
        gain from camp:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Trying New Things:</strong> Exploring your backyard, neighborhood or city is fun and
          important, but there are lots of games and activities at camp that you just can’t do at home!
          Kids get to try things like backpacking, river rafting and fishing.</li>
          <li><strong>Meeting New People:</strong> Kids get to meet campers from all over. The special
          environment of camp where kids are stretching and growing creates camaraderie and leads to meaningful
          friendships.</li>
          <li><strong>Challenging Themselves:</strong> Not everything at camp will be easy! By enduring setbacks
          and pushing themselves in a nourishing environment, kids gain resilience and experience the reward of
          achieving something.</li>
          <li><strong>Appreciating Nature:</strong> It can be great to take a break from what’s familiar, your
          family, friends and neighborhood to get back in touch with yourself and enjoy nature!</li>
          <li><strong>Learning New Skills:</strong> Not only will kids learn how to do new activities and sports
          such as music, creative writing or mountain climbing, living with a group of new people will teach them
          life skills like independence, cooperation and tolerance.</li>
          <li><strong>Being Active:</strong> Getting out and exploring with all the games and excursions at camp is
          a great way to have fun while exercising and healthier alternative to hanging out at home all summer.</li>
          <li><strong>Having Fun:</strong> Of course, the most important part about coming to camp is having fun!
          We offer a variety of outdoor & wilderness, day and overnight camps to choose from. Whatever their
          interest, whether it be creative writing, river rafting, music, backpacking or climbing, we’ve got a camp
          for that!</li>

        <p>Spending time around water can be relaxing and so much fun, but without the proper training,
        water can be deadly. Learning water safety skills can serve kids for their whole lives. Whether
        on camping trips, pool parties or trips to the beach, when kids are prepared, the chance of
        accident decreases significantly.</p>
        <p><strong>We can prevent accidental deaths</strong></p>
        <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, about ten people die everyday as a result of
        drowning. So many of those accidental deaths are preventable. With the right skills, individuals
        can be empowered to protect themselves around water, but also know the signs to look for when
        somebody else is struggling in the water.</p>
        <p><strong>The earlier the better</strong></p>
        <p>The longer you wait to educate your child about swimming and water safety, the harder it becomes.
        Younger kids are happy to jump right into swimming, but as kids get older, without skills they tend
        to build fearful aversion to the water which leaves them at a higher risk for water danger.</p>
        <p>Swimming is the pinnacle of fun for a lot of kids, but without a solid safety foundation, it is
        rife with danger. The YMCA’s Safety Around Water program wants to keep swimming fun by teaching
        essential water safety skills, including how personal water safety and skills to help others
        in the water.</p>
        <p>Safety Around Water is a free six week course at Meredith Mathews East Madison YMCA.</p>
        <p>This vital course is open to anyone in the community who wants their children to learn how to
        be safe in and around water!</p>

        <h3>Breathe, Stretch, Re-charge</h3>
        <p>Join instructor Jenny Leung as she helps you use yoga as a therapeutic antidote to stress: slowing

        levels. She will be helping you gently stretch the body in active postures before settling into passive
        restorative poses fully supported by props all within a still, quiet, and warm environment.</p>
        <p>This series will address ways to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Release muscle tension</li>
          <li>Quiet the mind</li>
          <li>Balance the nervous system</li>
          <li>Promote restful sleep</li>
          <li>Build mental, emotional and physical resilience</li>
