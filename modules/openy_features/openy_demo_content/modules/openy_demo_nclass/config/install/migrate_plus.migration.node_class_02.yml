        The Home School program has been designed to encourage children to get
        up and move. Each week they will participate in swimming, art, staff led
        games, and sports or fitness activities. Children will be divided into
        age groups for PE and by swim level for swim lessons. No class the week
        of April 10-14 (Spring Break) or April 17-21 due to remodeling in the
        family wing.

        This unique class is performed on a specialized piece of equipment
        called the Reformer. Pilates Reformer movements vary in intensity with
        an adjustable spring load while at the same time being easy on the
        joints. The extra support you get from these machines will help to
        engage the deeper muscles that stabilize your joints. The pace is
        moderate, yet challenging and will strengthen the core and provide an
        invigorating workout.

        Cancer is a life-changing disease that takes a tremendous physical and
        emotional toll on those affected. The Y and LIVESTRONG have joined
        together to create LIVESTRONG at the Y, a research-based physical
        activity and well-being program designed to help adults currently
        battling cancer as well as cancer survivors reclaim their total health.
        Participants work with Y staff who are trained in supportive cancer care
        to safely achieve such goals as building muscle mass and strength,
        increasing flexibility and endurance, and improving confidence and
        self-esteem. By focusing on the whole person and not the disease,
        LIVESTRONG at the Y helps people move beyond cancer in mind, body, and
        spirit.

      body: |
        <p>
        This unique class is performed on a specialized piece of equipment
        called the Reformer. Pilates Reformer movements vary in intensity with
        an adjustable spring load while at the same time being easy on the
        joints. The extra support you get from these machines will help to
        engage the deeper muscles that stabilize your joints. The pace is
        moderate, yet challenging and will strengthen the core and provide an
        invigorating workout.
        </br>
        Level 2 focuses on building strength and endurance through more advanced
        exercises that contain additional choreography and coordination.
        Participants must have an understanding of basic principles and
        exercises as learned in Level 1. Pace will be matched to participant's
        abilities.
        </p>

        <p>
        Class is taught in a small class setting of 4 students to 1 instructor
        to ensure personal attention. We are not able to refund for missed
        sessions but will do our best to provide up to 1 make-up session, with
        make-up date provided by the instructor.
        </p>

        <p>
        A 7 week session is $154/session ($22/class) for Facility members and
        $238/session ($34/class) for Community Members.

        This journey is a magical one week adventure on the Olympic Coast for
        students entering or already in high school. A land of barking seals,
        massive trees, and constant waves- the Olympic Coast makes the perfect
        backdrop for this backpacking expedition. You will trek in the lush
        rainforest, hike on sandy beaches, witness soaring bald eagles, and
        explore vibrant tide-pools filled with marine wild life. Your adventure
        will take you up and over headlands, camping each night just above the
        Pacific Ocean where you will watch dramatic sunsets and share epic
        stories around the campfire.

        Escaping the soggy confines of Seattle to the sunny climbing and rafting
        haven of Central Oregon, this trip is a true adventure! You will get to
        put your climbing skills to the test on the incredible landscape of
        Smith Rock State Park, which is home to some of the greatest climbs in
        the world. After soaking in the sun on the rock wall, you and your team
        will face new exciting challenges as you navigate the rapids on the
        picturesque Deschutes River. Challenging yourself on the mighty cliffs
        and rushing rivers of this region will leave you with new skills, and a
        sense of awe of the amazing landscapes that surround us. This trip
        promises to be the highlight of your summer!

        forests, be captivated by dramatic mountain landscapes, fish for trout,
        and develop leadership skills in ways you never thought possible. After
        taking on the challenge of the wilderness you will know you can overcome

        YMCA Earth Service Corps emerged out of an idea Bill Sieverling, then
        director of the YMCA of the USA’s International Office in Asia, proposed
        in the 1989 issue of the YMCA publication, International Notes. He
        suggested that given the YMCA’s tradition of youth leadership
        development and concern for the natural world that there was an
        opportunity to engage youth in a service-based leadership program that
        addressed growing concerns about the global environment.
