        Swimming at the Y helps people thrive—in and out of the water. Swim
        lessons provide kids and teens with the opportunity to set goals and
        achieve success, learn water safety and enjoy&nbsp;swimming as a form
        of exercise. Through swimming lessons, swim teams,&nbsp;lap swimming
        and more, the YMCA of the Greater Seattle provides a safe environment
        for swimmers of all ages and abilities.

        YMCA camps offer kids a chance to explore places, activities and ideas
        outside their normal lives. At camp, they discover new talents, new
        interests and new friends. Parents have trusted YMCA camps for
        generations, because, they are experiences that help foster leadership,
        self-confidence, and deepen respect for the environments and
        communities we live in. We offer a huge variety of camp locations,
        options and formats, so no matter what your background or summer
        schedule, there’s a place for your kids at a Y camp.

        The values and skills learned early in life are vital building blocks
        for a successful adulthood, and we believe all kids deserve a strong

        programs to support and nurture their children from infancy through
        the teen years and help them become strong, capable and engaged young
        people.
