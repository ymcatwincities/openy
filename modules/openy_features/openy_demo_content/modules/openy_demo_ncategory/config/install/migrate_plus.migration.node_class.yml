        <p>
        This unique class is performed on a specialized piece of equipment
        called the Reformer. Pilates Reformer movements vary in intensity with
        an adjustable spring load while at the same time being easy on the
        joints. The extra support you get from these machines will help to
        engage the deeper muscles that stabilize your joints. The pace is
        moderate, yet challenging and will strengthen the core and provide an
        invigorating workout.
        </br>
        Intro to Reformer focuses on the basic principles and foundational
        exercises of Reformer work. Breathing, body alignment, stabilization,
        and core strengthening are all highlighted. Pace is slower and perfect
        for those new to the Reformer apparatus.
        </p>

        <p>
        Level 1 focuses on expanding knowledge and application of basic Reformer
        exercises. Participants must have taken Intro to Reformer or have some
        experience with Reformer in order to take a Level 1 class. Additional
        exercises that strengthen the core and connect core to the periphery
        are explored. Pace may be slow or quick.
        </p>

        <p>
        Class is taught in a small class setting of 4 students to 1 instructor
        to ensure personal attention. We are not able to refund for missed
        sessions but will do our best to provide up to 1 make-up session, with
        make-up date provided by the instructor.

        YMCA Earth Service Corps emerged out of an idea Bill Sieverling, then
        director of the YMCA of the USA’s International Office in Asia, proposed
        in the 1989 issue of the YMCA publication, International Notes. He
        suggested that given the YMCA’s tradition of youth leadership
        development and concern for the natural world that there was an
        opportunity to engage youth in a service-based leadership program that
        addressed growing concerns about the global environment.
