        The Y is the starting point for many youth to learn about becoming and
        staying active, and developing healthy habits they’ll carry with them
        throughout their lives. The benefits gained through early exposure to
        fitness are far greater than just physical health.

        Small Group Training is a great way to stay motivated while reaching
        your goals. You will work with a personal trainer in a group of 3-6
        people. You can participate with an existing group or create your own
        with at least two other people.
        </p>

        Specialty training using TRX, Pilates Reformers and Queenax functional
        equipment is a great workout whether one-on-one or in a small group.
