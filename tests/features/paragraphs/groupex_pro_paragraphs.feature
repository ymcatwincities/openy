Feature: GroupEx Pro paragraphs

  Background: GroupEx Pro test setup
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Administrator" role
    Then I go to "/admin/config/services/openy_group_schedules/settings"
    And I fill in "GroupEx Account ID" with "36"
    Then I press the "Save configuration" button
    Then I go to "/admin/config/services/groupexpro"
    And I fill in "GroupEx Pro Account" with "36"
    Then I press the "Save configuration" button
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "Editor" role
    And I create paragraph of type group_schedules:
      | KEY                |
      | group_schedules_01 |
    And I create paragraph of type embedded_groupexpro_schedule:
      | KEY                |
      | embedded_groupexpro_schedule_01 |
    And I create large landing_page content:
      | KEY             | behat_group_schedules | behat_embedded_groupexpro_schedules |
      | title           | BEHAT GROUP SCHEDULES | BEHAT EMBEDDED GROUPEX SCHEDULES    |
      | field_lp_layout | one_column            | one_column                          |
      | field_content   | group_schedules_01    | embedded_groupexpro_schedule_01     |
