Feature: Blog Content type
  As Admin I want to make sure that Blog content type is OK

  Background: Add background content as needed
    Given I am logged in as a user with the Editor role
    Given I create taxonomy_term of type blog_category:
      | name               |
      | BEHAT CATEGORY ONE |
    And I create media of type image:
      | KEY              | name                 | field_media_image    |
      | behat_blog_image | behat_blog_image.jpg | behat_blog_image.jpg |
    And I create large branch content:
      | title                               | BEHAT BRANCH 01 |
      | field_location_address:country_code | US              |
      | :address_line1                      | Main road 10    |
      | :locality                           | Seattle         |
      | :administrative_area                | WA              |
      | :postal_code                        | 98101           |
      | field_location_coordinates:lat      | 47.293433       |
      | :lng                                | -122.238717     |
