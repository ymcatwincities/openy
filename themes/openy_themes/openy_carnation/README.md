# Maintaining the theme.

##1. Install Yarn

###macOS

####Homebrew

You can install Yarn through the Homebrew package manager. 
This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

`brew install yarn`

If you use nvm or similar, you should exclude installing Node.js 
so that nvmâ€™s version of Node.js is used.

`brew install yarn --without-node`

####MacPorts

You can install Yarn through MacPorts. 
This will also install Node.js if it is not already installed.

`sudo port install yarn`

###Debian / Ubuntu

https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#debian-stable

###Windows
https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

##2. Go to the theme's folder

`yarn install`

##2a. If your grunt command is not available now, install grunt-cli, using this command:
`sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`

##3. Compile all assets

`grunt build`

On some systems ( OSX ) grunt is not available globally, so just use it from node_modules

`.//node_modules/grunt/bin/grunt build`

##4. Start watching all assets (for development)

`grunt watch`
